# In class:  
On Thursday in class Bill Reyner came to speak. It was very interesting to hear about open source from the perspective of the private sector. It seems that many companies contribute to open-source projects. Sometimes they do it just to give back to the community, or to recruit, or because a project they worked on might be maintained by the community, or to band together agains a competitor. Of course, almost all of these are within the scope of helping themselves, but I guess the private sector has to thrive on something :) I missed class on Monday unfortunately, do to a Jewish holiday. (Shemini Atzeret in the US).


# Outside of class:
I commented on an issue in [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery), and somebody responded a few days later. I think I'm gonna start tackling [this issue](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues/5853). I'm excited, because the project seems active, and I think I may actually be able to contribute some code.
