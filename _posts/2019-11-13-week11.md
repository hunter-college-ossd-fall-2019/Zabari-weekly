My issue got jacked, so I found a new one, and this time it was [assigned to me](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues/6015). Seems like an easier issue anyway so we'll see what happens. I've been working on it, and building the project takes a ton of time, which is unfortunate haha. I think it's mostly because of all the cloning. That's probably the most challenging part, though there's also the aspect of trying to install an older version of git in order to properly test this.

I read the [System76 article](https://opensource.com/article/19/11/coreboot-system76-laptops?utm_campaign=intrel). It seems pretty cool. It's very interesting to consider that most open-source firmware is pretty rare. I guess that technicaly if the operating system is open source, and the driver is limited in scope by the operating system, proprietary firmware isn't inherently *unsafe* but it has the potential to be.
