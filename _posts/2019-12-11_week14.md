It is strange to have finally reached this blog post, as it's been sitting in the repo for a while. In class, we had a quiz, which I did not do so hot on. Other than that we mostly covered Linux commands, and spoke about how open-source can be a business, though I still have unanswered questions, of course :)

Making one's career in open source certainly seems to be a grueling, non-trivial task. And I guess almost nobody does it. A lot of serious contributors have full-time jobs somewhere, I'm sure only a select few get paid by their companies to specifically contribute.

In terms of my contributions, I do not think I made any new ones this week unfortunately. I already got a PR merged into osquery, and I made 5 contributions to Wikipedia in previous weeks. I spend a lot of my free time helping people with their computer science homework, and although I guess that is not technically open-source, I am helping them for free, as in free beer :D But also they are welcome to pass it forward, as in free software.
