I think that this course sort of met my expectations. I wish that we had started covering Linux and Bash earlier. I also would have liked to start my "big" conribution earlier. In terms of my dreams, they were lofty, and I knew that, but I think I met or exceeded my own expectations for contributing. I don't think I truly believed that I would be able to even **build** a project, and so that I was able to find one, and contribute something that was *almost* code, is exciting to me. So I don't want to say I would change my asnwers, because I still maintain lofty dreams, but I know that I still have a lot of work left to do. :)
