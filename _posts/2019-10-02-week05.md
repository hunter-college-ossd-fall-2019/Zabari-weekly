title: Week 5

On Thursday in class we all practiced collaborating on a git repository in groups of 3. We created issues and opened pull requests, as per the guide posted. I updated my contributions file with a few contributions that got approved. I posted a question to ask Karen Sandler. I read the article found [here](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to). I think the reading was pretty good, and really helps make contributing more approachable. I am curious as to what exactly a "casual" contribution is, but it's good that more than a fourth of "casual" contributions are just documentation, formatting, or translations. That gives me hope, maybe I can already consider myself a "casual" contributor and more contributions lie in my future :D
