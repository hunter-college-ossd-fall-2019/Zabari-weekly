# In class:  
On Thursday in class we did an activity where we had to explore an open source repository. Marco and I explored [empathy](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/empathy) and found that it was not very active. On Wednesday in class I looked through many repositories, and found [osquery](https://github.com/osquery/osquery) which is pretty active and I am tending towards contributing to.


The project evaluations were actually rather tedious, and they required a lot of poking around in the repository, as well as a lot of specific counting (i.e. count the number of commits per week over the last twelve weeks). However, it definitely helped direct what to look for in contributing to a project, especially in terms of finding out how active a project is. Osquery seems like a decent fit for me. It is very active, and people are consistently opening and closing issues and pull requests. It's written in C++, which is not my first language choice, but I think I'm comfortable enough to try it out. If that fails, there are parts of the project written in Python and Bash as well, so perhaps I can check those out.

I also contributed to the [mpich](https://www.mpich.org/) docs this week!
