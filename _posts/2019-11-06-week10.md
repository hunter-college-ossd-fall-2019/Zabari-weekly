title: Week 10
---

This week we went over our projects, and then we went over bash. I knew most of the stuff we went over.

Wikipedia seems like it may be nontrivial to contibrute to. So many people speak the English language, and I can't just use things that I already know from my head, probably because much of my knowledge comes from Wikipedia. Here's an obligatory xkcd: [https://m.xkcd.com/903/](https://m.xkcd.com/903/). This means I'll have to think of information I have form other sources, or figure out where to find good primary sources.

This week I figured out how to properly build the project I picked. I'm going to be working on [this issue](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues/5853) hopefully. I think I narrowed down the problem to the `devtools/shell.cpp` file. I've made some basic edits, just to play around, and now I'm looking for the place where the erroneous error message gets printed (by just finding in files, and inserting my own code).

Unfortunately I ran out of time here.
